# Type Racer V1

Type Racer V1 is an engaging and interactive browser-based game where users race against time by typing words as they appear on the screen. Words dynamically move from left to right, and players must type them correctly before they reach the edge of the screen. Words are dynamically fetched using the [Datamuse API](https://www.datamuse.com/api/)
